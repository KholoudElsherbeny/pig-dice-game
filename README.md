#### The game is about throwing a dice in a random way, and he prefers to collect the numbers every time, and it appears in the target, and when I come to work hold, he keeps the total that he reached and makes a switch for the second player
The dice has a probability of 1:6, so any number that appears collects, unless the number 1 appears, the switch works for the second player.
And the target is at 50, whoever reaches 50 and above is the one who is the one who is the one who ends the game
